# Detection-of-Phishing-URL-by-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
**Objective:**
<br>The main objective of this project is to identify the Phishing URLs, based of various parameters like protocols, domains, sub-domains, extensions, and manny other parameters. A phishing Universsal Resource Locator(URL) is a URL, which mimics mimics trustful URLs, and try to steal your information. In this project, I trained a machine learning model on the dataset, collected from an open source Kaggle. I used the dataset on various machine learning algorithms, and chose XGBoost alogorithm, over other algorithms beacause of its high accuracy prediction.<br/>

**Model Training:**
<br>This data set comes under classification problem, as the input URL is classified as phishing (1) or legitimate (0). The algorithms used to train the model using the dataset are:<br/>
<br>Random Forest Classifier<br/>
Support Vector Machine<br/>
Decision Tree Classifier<br/>
K-Nearest Neighbors<br/>
Logistic Regression<br/>
Multi-layer Perceptron<br/>
Gradient Boosting Classifier<br/>
XGBoost Classifier<br/>
Naive Bayes Classifier<br/>
<br>The model is trained on the dataset extracted from Kaggle.<br/>

**Output:**
<br>A pop-up window will open asking for you to enter the URL. After entering the URL, you click on the check button. This displays the probability of the URL, whether it is a phishing website or a legitimate website.<br/>

**Research Paper:**
<br>Co-authored and published a research paper titled "**Securing the web using URL based analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms**" and presented it at the **5th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Social Networking (ICPCSN)**.<br/>
